# Smash Hit Builder and Room Generator Project

This repository contains Smash Hit room generators based on my research of procedureal content generation in games. Please do not expect any of the code in this repository to be of any reasonable quality.

The scripts in the repo are written in either Python or meant to be run as a Smash Hit room. I might switch to using Lua for the scripts in the future.

## Smash Hit Builder (`smashhitbuilder.py`)

An expimental and "oh-balls-I-forgot-to-document-it" Python library to aid in exporting and generating Smash Hit segments.

## Gen1 (`gen1.py`)

The (very carefully named) 1st "generation" segment and room generator, largely based on pure brute force generation, but perhaps you can see where I was going.

## Classic Generated Rooms (`online`)

The classic generated rooms room script. This is kept here for reference.
