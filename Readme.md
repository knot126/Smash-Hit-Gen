# Smash Hit Randomisers

This repository contains Smash Hit room generators based on my research of procedureal content generation in games. Please do not expect any of the code in this repository to be of any reasonable quality.

## Scripts

There are a few different scripts:

 * `smashhitbuilder.py`: A base library for building Smash Hit segments.
 * `gen1.py`: A very simple test of smashhitbuilder.
 * `gen2-zebra.py`: Incomplete genertaion of more advnaced rooms.
 * `online`: The random genrated rooms mod sources.
